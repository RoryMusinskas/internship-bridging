# Internship bridging project

### Objectives
- Fetch API data
- Display API data
- Next button should fetch and display new API data
- Add to favourites button should store the currently fetch result as a favourite and it should persist between new fetches until page refresh.
- Attempt to use atomic design principles.

### Learning Goals
- This was a simple project to do between end of bootcamp and the start of my internship next week.
- This was to practise using styled components and the very basics of Typescript within React.
- Learn about atomic design principles.

### Challenges
- I struggled to figure out how to make a state Array that will only allow objects of the shape defined by the api call and to then pass it along as props to children. 
- I also struggled a little bit passing on the state and setState function and setting the correct type in the children.
